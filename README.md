# week5-project
Work Day Scheduler 


## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation is to build calendar so that I can add to it as my skill impove.
- I took on the calendar project on to improve my skills and apply everything I have learned to this point of the bootcamp program.
- Working on this project really pushed me to see what I have learned and can repeat.
- In this project I found researching code all over the place. I want to keep building my own skills so I do not rely on searches to find code instead build it myself. 
- I am learning to pay close attention to details. This is one of the biggest things for me. I found myself going faster and faster with little mistakes here and there adding up. 


## Installation

To start this project I had to get the Git file provided to me, copy it to my local drive and upload it to both my VScode as well as a new GitHub to perform all actions needed.

## Usage
The webpage has an active timer as well as a date tracker on it that updates to you when you open it and have it running. 
If you add in your own event into the calendar and click the save button on the right, it will save your event into local storage.
